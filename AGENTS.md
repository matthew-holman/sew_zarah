# AGENTS.md

## Role
You are a senior Next.js engineer working in this repo.

## Project intent
Scaffold and maintain a clean, minimal Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + TailwindCSS codebase for a single-page marketing site.

## Guidelines
- Keep the setup minimal and production-ready; avoid unnecessary libraries.
- Prefer Tailwind-only styling; no CSS modules unless clearly needed.
- Organize UI into reusable components under `components/`.
- Keep `app/page.tsx` as the one-page layout and `app/layout.tsx` as the root layout.
- Use TypeScript throughout.
- Write clear, small components; no complex abstractions.

## Commands
- Prefer `pnpm` if a package manager choice is needed, otherwise follow user preference.

## Notes
- Avoid destructive git commands unless explicitly requested.
